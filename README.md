# Image-Color-Quantization-
Image Quatization using C# and Graph Theory

## What is Image Quantization?
Quantization is a lossy (some of the information is lost) compression technique achieved 
by compressing a range of values to a single quantum value. Image or color quantization 
is a technique where the number of colors is reduced; this is important for displaying 
images on devices that support a limited number of colors and for efficiently compressing 
certain kinds of images. Most editors and many operating 
systems have built-in support for color quantization. The reduced representative colors are 
called color palette. The quantization process should be optimized as possible so that not much 
information is lost and the new quantized image should differ as little as possible from the original image.

## Description
The project aims to quantize image to a smaller size by decreasing the colors in it so the image looks a bit different
using smaller colors. All is listed in the documentation which is attached with the project or through this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lynXuhKZ_zWtjY5fHz2EP6pXDDmQy2oQLSRrjAMjPN8/edit?usp=sharing)
any comment is appreciated.
